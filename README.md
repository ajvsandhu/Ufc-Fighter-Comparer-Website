# UFC Fighter Data Collecter and API
This is a project I created with my friend (shariqsk, Shariq Khan) to practice collecting data from a website, storing it in an SQL database, and using queries to extract data. Built an API to get data from the database for further use. Collected every fighter's data from http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters by building a scrapper, from their career averages to data from their last 5 fights. The SQL database can be viewed with SQLite and is located in the Api Folder. In the fighters.py file, you can see how to use SQL queries to extract data. Currently working to use the scrapper and API to create a website that compares the stats of two fighters selected by a user by showing tables and graphs, COMING SOON!!!
