# UFC Fighter Data Collecter and API
This is a project I created with my friend [Shariq Safdar Khan](https://github.com/shariqsk) to practice collecting data from a website, storing it in an SQL database, and using queries to extract data. Built an API to get data from the database for further use. Collected every fighter's data from http://ufcstats.com/statistics/fighters by building a scrapper, from their career averages to data from their last 5 fights. The Website can be viewed here[here](https://ufc-fighter-data-api.vercel.app/), where you can view and compare any of your favourite MMA fighters stats.
